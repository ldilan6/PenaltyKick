You can use the DPad if you are thinking of doing an iOS or Android deploy. Just enable the controls in Scene hierarchy and it will work. 
You will see a pad + 2 buttons ( A to pass/tackle and B to shoot).
The Select Team Scene just let you choose between 4 teams.
The Football Scene is composed of two teams (player vs CPU ) and you can already play something resembling an actual soccer match!
